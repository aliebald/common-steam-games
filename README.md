## Getting started
Beginn by creating a new session [here](https://aliebald.github.io/common-steam-games/create, "Common Steam Games link") using your steam id, invite your friends and rearrange your preferences using drag and drop. Any changes will instantly be synchronized with all other session members. To Invite others, copy the invite link on the top right or open your friendslist, which will load your steam friends and allow you to create personal invites, removing the need to find the steam id for your friends.
